            <p> My name is Kirill. I'm 18 years old.I'm from Latvia, city Liepaja.I studied at the RKG until the 9th grade.
                Then he entered the RVT technical school as a programmer technician. Now I'm on the 3rd course.
                I like to play computer games, spend time with friends and do something stupid that takes a long time to correct the consequences 
                (lick a pole for 5 lats, jump from the 1st floor or just ride a bike in the forest and get lost in it).
                I was into swimming, robotics, jujutsu and learning bass guitar and foreign languages.
                I can describe myself as a memorable, unusual, interesting person for conversation, cheerful, shy, a person with developed logic, lazy, stubborn and purposeful. </p>
